###### ###### ###### ###### 1. EasyBooking Hotel Booking App,

## 1. Introduce your project, explaining the problem it solves and the different features it offers.

<!-->

    The aims to simplify the process of hotel booking for users. The problem it solves is the time-consuming and often confusing task of finding and booking hotels at desired locations. With this app, users can easily search for hotels, view detailed information, and make reservations seamlessly.-->

<!-->

    Firstly, it provides a hotel search functionality, allowing users to input their desired location, dates, and search terms to find suitable hotels. The app displays detailed information about each hotel, including multiple photos, available facilities, ratings, and more. -->

## 2. Which technology did you use for developing the project? Why did you choose this technology?

 <!-->

    I used React Native Expo , React Native Redux for State management , Firebase for Hotel Details store dynamically and Async storage

-->

## 3. Why did you choose React Native over Flutter for this project?

<!--
    I am very familiarity with React js and Javascript so based on existing skill i chose react native and based on my experience and the specific requirements of the project i choose React Native

    I choose firebase becuase i need quick and fast online database that's why
    I choose Redux compare to context api becuase context api is helpful but in this application flow is more complex so choose redux .
 -->

## 4. What difficulties did you face during the development of this project?

<!--
    One of the difficulties was synchronizing real-time data updates from Firebase to the app's UI efficiently.

    Another challenge was managing the rendering and performance of large amounts of hotel data. Displaying multiple hotel photos, ratings, and facilities while maintaining smooth scrolling
 -->

## 5. What improvements do you envision for your project in the future?

<!--
    1. Integrating payment gateways to enable users to complete bookings directly within the app.
    2. I would like to enhance the app's recommendation system by incorporating machine learning algorithms to provide more personalized hotel suggestions based on user preferences and historical data.
 -->

## 6. What was your motivation behind developing this project?

<!--
    I address the common pain points users face when booking hotels. I wanted to create a user-friendly and intuitive app that simplifies the process, allowing users to find and book hotels quickly and effortlessly.
 -->

## 7. In the "EasyBooking Hotel Booking App," you mentioned storing liked hotel results and booked hotel details using async storage. Can you explain the reasoning behind choosing async storage for data storage in your app and discuss any considerations you had while implementing this feature?

<!--
    The decision to use async storage was based on a few key considerations. Firstly, async storage provides a lightweight and efficient solution for storing relatively small amounts of data, making it suitable for storing liked hotel results and booking details. This approach avoids the need for complex database setup and minimizes network requests for retrieving frequently accessed data.

    Additionally, async storage offers a simple and straightforward API, making it easy to implement and integrate into the app's logic. It provides methods for storing, retrieving, and deleting data, as well as support for asynchronous operations, ensuring smooth user experience while accessing stored data.
 -->

## 8. In your "EasyBooking Hotel Booking App," you mentioned using Redux. Can you explain how you implemented Redux in your project and discuss the benefits it brought to the app's state management?
